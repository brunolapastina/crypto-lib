# Crypto primitives

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brunolapastina/brpc/master/LICENSE)

This repo is just me having a go at implementing some crypto primitives

- [Design goals](#design-goals)
- [Integration](#integration)
- [Examples](#examples)
- [License](#license)

## Design Goals

My only goal is to learn more about cryptography.
This library is NOT production ready.

## Integration

To use this library, you first need to include the desired primitive header (look into the include folder), then link it to the static library generated by the makefile.
To compile, just run

```bash
make
```

this will generate the .a in the root folder

## Examples

The [test folder](test) and the [benchmarks folder](benchmarks) has some examples.
